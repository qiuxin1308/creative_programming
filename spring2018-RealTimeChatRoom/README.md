### Notes ###
The left area shows the list of chat rooms, the middle area shows messages in this chat room and the list of users in current chat room,
and the right area shows privates message which are sent by the other users to the current user. When the current user is the 
owner of the current room, it will display "kick", "ban", "unblock" buttons below the send message field and the "send" button.
You can enter a chat room by clicking the name of the room in the list of chat rooms. You can also send the private message to
the person in the current chat room by clicking the name of the user in the user list.

### Creative Portion ###
1.When the person is kicked or banned by the owner of the current room, it will show on the middle area to let the other users
in this room to know.  
2.Users can ban private messages from anyone no matter the banned user in the same room or not by clicking "ban message" button.  
3.If you are the owner of the current chat room, you will also display the third button named "unblock". You can unblock the user 
who is banned by you in the room you created, which means you cannot unblock the user who is not banned by you in your room.
